I spent a month teaching at Institut Enric Borras, a public high school in
Badalona, Spain (a suburb of Barcelona). I prepared original math, chemistry,
and electrical engineering materials and led classes start to finish at the
school in English. This was especially challenging because English was the third
language for the vast majority of students.
