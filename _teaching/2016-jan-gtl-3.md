I spent a month on a team of four MIT students teaching out of a community 
greenhouse in Ein Shemer, Israel. We taught hydroponic farming techniques, 
plant biology, and science communication in English to students ranging across 
middle and high school who would visit for field trips. We also hosted a
recurring after school enrichment program focused on building end to end
hydroponic farm systems.
