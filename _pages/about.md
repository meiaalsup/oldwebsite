I'm Meia and I am pursuing my Master's of Engineering in computer
science at MIT. I work on the Future of Energy Storage Study in the MIT Energy
Initiative, and am specifically working on forecasting electricity demand in the
the data-poor context of India. 

My research interests span distributes systems, machine learning, and optimization.

Previously, I have worked at Lyft, [Station A](https://stationa.com/), [Enernet 
Global](http://www.enernetglobal.com/), and 
[Clean Power Research](https://www.cleanpower.com/).

I am an all things sustainability nerd. Specifically I am excited about
sustainable agriculture, transportation, and energy. I am also a
[Climate Voice](https://climatevoice.org/about/) ambassador and
excited about helping enable the collective voice of the masses.

I am also an avid cyclist, backpacker, and outdoor adventurer. When not
exploring the outdoors, I am often salsa dancing, doodling on the flute, 
practicing my broken Mandarin and Spanish, or experimenting with plant based
ingredients in the kitchen.
